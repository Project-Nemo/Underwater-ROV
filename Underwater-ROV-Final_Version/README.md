# Underwater-ROV

####The Underwater ROV is an open source project that currently only offers observational functionality to users. The aim of our project is to improve the ROV (see http://www.techmonkeybusiness.com/opensource-rov.html) by making it more appealing for research groups, for example NIWA and GWRC.
